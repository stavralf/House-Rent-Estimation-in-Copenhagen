# House-Rent-Estimation-in-Copenhagen

## About
We collect information from a popular Housing Portal in Copenhagen. Then, we build a linear regression model which incorporates various apartment traits and finally provides an estimation of the expected monthly rent. 
Variables selected for the performing predictions are: Size, Neighborhood, Number of Rooms, Balcony. Given that, our model is able to provide an estimation for the expected apartment rent while grasping into consideration
the majority of the advertised apartments for rent in Copenhagen.

## Overview
Variables are explored, new variables are crafted, simple, at first, then multi linear regression models are fitted, examined and assessed. Inference and prediction accuracy of model are discussed from various standpoints,
while techniques such as Weighted Least Squares(WLS) for tackling heteroskedasticity of errors or Ridge Regression to robust prediction efficiency and mitigate collinearity and multicollinearity, are employed. 

## Future Development
An interactive platform where users looking for renting a house, input their preferences, and get a sophisticated prediction coupled with a confidence interval of the Monthly Net Rent.
